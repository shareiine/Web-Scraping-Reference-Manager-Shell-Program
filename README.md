WebCite is a citation generator created using BASH script and was developed using the web scraping technique. Web scraping allows the collection of data by extracting the necessary information from a web page. However, web scraping has ethical and legal concerns since not all websites allow scraping. Thus, the ‘robots.txt’ file was checked to confirm whether a web page could be scrapped. The presented system allows users primarily to cite from four tech-related websites: GeeksforGeeks, TutorialsPoint, W3Schools, and BYJU’s. For this program, three citation styles for the generated citation list are presented, namely, APA, MLA, and IEEE.
